# Tkinter-Password-Manager
Very simple Python password manager with the tkinter module. It has a Add, View, Copy, Search (with built in deletion) and generate a password which can be used in a future account.
Just make sure you set the correct folder you want the copy to go to as the default is simply the folder the project normal is in.
